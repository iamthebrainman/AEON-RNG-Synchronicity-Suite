# AEON: RNG Synchronicity Suite
### *Advanced Entropy Monitoring \u0026 Calibration for Parapsychological Research*

## 🌌 Overview

**AEON** is a specialized toolset designed for researchers exploring the boundaries of mind-matter interaction, telepathy, and anomalous cognition. By utilizing high-fidelity entropy monitoring and adaptive calibration, AEON allows users to detect and log "synchronicities"—non-random fluctuations in entropy streams that correlate with focused intent or external events.

## 📈 Real-Time Monitoring: Random Number Visualizer

The heart of the AEON suite is the **Random Number Visualizer** (`RandomNumberVisualizer.py`), a sophisticated dashboard for real-time entropy analysis.

### Features:
- **Triple-View Visualization**:
  - **Instantaneous Probability**: Monitor the real-time bias (p-value) of your entropy source.
  - **The Cumulative Walk**: Track long-term drift and deviation from the expected random mean.
  - **Frequency Morphing Waterfall**: Visualize the spectral evolution of the entropy stream using Welch's PSD method.
- **Intelligent Anomaly Engine**:
  - **Statistical Detection**: Real-time logging of Chi-Square significance and run-length streaks.
  - **FFT Analysis**: Detects persistent frequency peaks, spectral order, and unexpected power shifts.
  - **Pattern Repetition**: Tracks hex signatures to identify repeating "motifs" in the data stream.
- **Synchronicity Status**: Dynamic indicators (ORDERED, SYNCHRONICITY!) based on real-time spectral entropy and drift analysis.

## 🔮 Multi-Dimensional Calibration

The **Calibration Mode** (`CalibrationMode.py`) acts as a search engine for identifying high-bias channels across various parameter spaces.

### Features:
- **Adaptive Oracle**: An experimental predictor that utilizes feedback loops to learn mappings between RNG states and targets.
- **Hidden Bit Sources**: Supports multiple "ground truth" generators for rigorous cross-validation:
  - **Internal Feedback**: Tests if the entropy stream predicts its own future state.
  - **PRNG Resonance**: Cross-references separate generators for synchronous behavior.
  - **Temporal Hashing**: Uses unpredictable but deterministic time-based hashes.
  - **Fractal Mapping**: Maps entropy to the complex-plane iterations of the Mandelbrot set.
- **Session Results**: Real-time Z-scoring, hit-rate analysis, and probability-of-chance calculations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `tkinter`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`

### 2. Launch
Initialize the monitoring suite:
```bash
python RandomNumberVisualizer.py
```
- **Start/Stop**: Control the real-time entropy stream.
- **🔮 Calibration**: Open the multi-dimensional search engine to find high-resonance channels.
- **Note-Taking**: Add timestamped markers to your session logs for easier correlation with mental focus or external events.

## 📜 Logging \u0026 Export

AEON automatically logs all sessions to the `rng_logs/` directory.
- **CSV Data**: Raw timestamps and bitstreams for external analysis.
- **JSON Metadata**: Comprehensive session summaries, including anomaly events and calibration results.
